# 👋 Hi, I'm Tanjim Haque — Aspiring Mechanical Engineer

I'm an aspiring Mechanical Engineer passionate about mechanical design, robotics, and innovation. With experience in CAD modeling for FTC robotics, hands-on fabrication, and a growing interest in aeronautics and F1 engineering, I aim to bridge the gap between creative design and practical engineering solutions. I’m also exploring coding, simulation, and rapid prototyping to complement my mechanical skills.

I'm using GitHub to showcase my work, track my engineering journey, and collaborate with others as I grow as a developer and designer.
